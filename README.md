# BDiDL

BDiDL study group resources.

## Mission Statement

Get an "in-depth" understanding of Machine Learning(which includes Deep Learning) while making demonstrable progress in it.

### Definition of "In-depth understanding of ML"

Having a **functional understanding** of the techniques and the math behind ML.

### Definition of "demonstrable progress"

The best way to get validated, imo, for our efforts is to exercise our ML knowledge by producing ML related content and exposing it for public scrutiny.   

We'll do that by periodically: 
- Writing relevant blog posts
- Creating Jupyter notebooks or Kaggle kernels(demonstrating a technique on some dataset). 
- Contributing to opensource ML related content(code, documentation, research)
- Publishing Papers

Essentially, any artifact through which we can give something back to the ML community. 

## Requirements

- Participants are good to have a functional understanding of Machine Learning in general.
- Participants should be comfortable with programming in either R or Python

## Resources
### Primary Resource
Primary resource that we aim to cover is the famous ML book by bishop, [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf)

### Other Resources
- [Awesome Machine Learning](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning)
- Any other reputable resource
